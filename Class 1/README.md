## First class - lecture notes

### Introduction

- We're studying systems, which are "non-deterministic" by name.
- BUT: Macroscopic systems are always determined by microscopic fluctuations.

- Main question: do fluctuations contain any information? -> A: Yes!! -> It's important to research them.
- We're studying those systems (mostly), where fluctuations occure around their state of equilibrium.

### History of Brownian-motion

- The basic idea originates from [Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist,_born_1773)), 1827
- He studied the motion of pollens in liquids at rest. He saw, that particles are moving randomly in the liquid and concluded that they're moving on their own, as all living creature does that. But: he also observes the same type of motion for non-living particles too (sand, salt, etc.) and thus cannot explain the phenomenon.
- Einstein [publishes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c1d/91a9f0a37e578ee9a6605b224ad554ec6e86.pdf) an article about the subject in 1905 and gives a mathematical model for its physics. He shows that the motion is not originates from some intrisic nature as Brown proposed, but rather from the molecular structure of liquids and gases. The medium in question contains randomly moving particles and molecules, which also randomly pushes the pollens from all directions and that produces its movement.
- Independently from Einstein, Smoluchowski [also publishes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/andp.19063261405) a paper about the Brownian-motion in 1906 and comes to the same conclusion.
- Langevin [also](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.18725) gives a description, in 1908. His work is the first, which defines the diffusion coefficient with measurable physical quantities, and thus makes it possible to measure the Avogadro constant.
- Perrin, using these articles succesfully measures the Avogadro constant in the same year, in 1908.
- These discoveries greatly strengthen the atomic theory of matter, which isn't recognized in that time.

### Movement of a pollen

- We're observing the position of a particle from time to time at $\tau$ intervals.
- We assume, that the direction of the displacement is independent from the previous ones.
